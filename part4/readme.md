# Part 4: Reflection & Documentation

## Part 1: Algorithm Complexity Analysis

this part of the assignment is all about algorithm. Analysis algorithm with precision (help Complexity). There are lot place where need to trade off or need use the data structure a little bit different manage.
On this part I need think more about complexity instead of code implementation. At First I was nervous, although I completed those tasks.

## Part 2: Custom Data Structures

### Time-Aware Linked List

This is a very simple data structure to implement. Although I gave me some pain. But successfully implement this data structure

### Event-Driven Linked List

As frontend dev, I use event every time. So this event driven thing is very much familiar. I was nervous at first. Then I read the requirements, created new interface with methods. Then problem is solved the ds implemented. Although I looks complex or hard, this is not that complex or hard as I thought earlier.

## Part 3: Real-World Problem Solving

### Inventory Lookup System

To not make the previous mistake, I first read the requirement then create a basic interface (as I am using TS). Then implement this interface step by step. In this portion, I learned about complex validation. I mistakenly mismatched most of validation. I learned about checking and validation also modularity.

### Recent Posts Feed

This is obvious, I had to implement, as I write article or blog. So I have some knowledge in this. I implemented this very easily except on part. To maintaining the lasted 10 posts. It took me over 3hr to solve this problem. Eventually I solved that problem.
